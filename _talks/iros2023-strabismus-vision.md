In this talk, I presented our work **See What a Strabismus Patient Sees Using Eye Robots**, which introduces the first robotic eye platform capable of simulating and visualizing what strabismus patients actually see.  
We developed a binocular robotic eye system that replicates human eye rotations and employs a homography-based vision fusion method. This platform allows ophthalmologists and researchers to observe double and blurry vision as experienced by patients, providing new insights into diagnosis and treatment evaluation.  

The presentation highlighted:  
- The design of the cable-driven robotic eye system  
- A homography-based binocular vision fusion pipeline  
- Experimental validation with healthy subjects and a strabismus patientâ€™s misalignment data
