**Abstract.** This work presents a cable-driven robotic eye that closely replicates the size, movement, and extraocular muscle structure of the human eye. By applying force-distributed control strategies and binocular rendering, the platform enables visualization of what strabismus patients perceive and provides a novel way to assess the severity of misalignment. The system serves both as a research tool for studying ocular biomechanics and as a potential aid for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning.
