Hi, I am **Yidi Huang**, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at **George Mason University (GMU)**, advised by [Dr. Ningshi Yao](https://ningshiyao.com/). 
I also work closely with [Dr. Qi Wei](https://volgenau.gmu.edu/profiles/qwei2) and [Dr. Quentin Sanders](https://www.gmu.edu/profiles/qsanders).  
My research further builds upon the foundational theories and insights developed by [Dr. Joseph L Demer](https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/joseph-demer), whose work on ocular biomechanics and pulley structures has been central to this field.
  

🔬 My Research & Work

I design **robotic eyes** to understand how our real eyes move and how vision works.  
My work combines **robot design, vision science, and math modeling** to explore:  

- 👁 **Robotic Eye Models** – building cable-driven robotic eyes that mimic how human eye muscles move  
- 🧩 **Eye Movements & Control** – using simplified mathematical models to explain and predict how the eyes rotate and stay stable  
- 👓 **Binocular Vision Fusion** – studying how two eyes combine images into one, and recreating this process with robots  
- 🎯 **Replicating Strabismus Vision** – developing robotic-eye simulations that reproduce what patients with strabismus (eye misalignment) actually see, supporting diagnosis and treatment  
- 🖥 **Real-Time Vision Fusion (Our Approach)** – we proposed a new visual synthesis method that generates **real-time binocular fused vision**, allowing doctors and researchers to directly experience how the world looks through two eyes

💼 Work Experience

### Epitome Research and Innovations Inc.

During my time at Epitome Research and Innovations Inc., I worked on research and development related to next-generation biomedical sensing technologies. My contributions were connected to the development of intelligent vision-related systems and wearable eye-tracking concepts.

- 🔬 **Smart Contact Lens Research** – contributed to the development of a smart contact lens platform for eye tracking and physiological monitoring  
- 👁 **Eye Tracking Integration** – explored how embedded sensing and vision technologies can be used for real-time gaze estimation  
- 🧠 **Biomedical & Vision Applications** – supported research linking eye movement signals with health monitoring and human–machine interaction
