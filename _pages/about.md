Hi, I am **Yidi Huang**, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at **George Mason University (GMU)**, advised by [Dr. Ningshi Yao](https://ningshiyao.com/). 
I also work closely with [Dr. Qi Wei](https://volgenau.gmu.edu/profiles/qwei2) and [Dr. Quentin Sanders](https://www.gmu.edu/profiles/qsanders).  
My research further builds upon the foundational theories and insights developed by [Dr. Joseph Louis Demer](https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/joseph-demer), whose work on ocular biomechanics and pulley structures has been central to this field.
  

My research focuses on:  
- 👁 **Building Robotic Eyes** – designing cable-driven robotic models that mimic how human eye muscles move  
- 🔄 **Studying Eye Movements** – using mathematical models to explain how the eye rotates and stays stable
- 👓 **Binocular Vision Fusion** – studying how two robotic eyes can work together to form a single, fused image like human vision  
- 🧠 **Understanding Vision Problems** – creating simulated visualization to show how people with strabismus (eye misalignment) actually see the world

👨‍💻 **I work on:**
- **Robot design and control** – cable-driven robotic eye platforms mimicking extraocular muscles  
- **Real-time binocular vision fusion based on robotic eye** – reconstructing patient-specific vision for diagnosis and visualization  
- **Mathematical modeling of the human eye structure** – torque–muscle mapping under Listing’s Law and pulley constraints  
- **Optimization and control of nonlinear systems** – force-distributed control and dynamics-based modeling
