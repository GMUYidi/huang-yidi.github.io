During my role as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for **ECE Mobile Robots**, I supported students in project-based learning focused on robot kinematics, sensing, and control.  
My responsibilities included assisting with lab sessions, providing technical mentorship on programming and robotics hardware, and helping students successfully implement their robot projects.
