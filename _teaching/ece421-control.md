As a Graduate Teaching Assistant for **ECE421 Classical System and Control Theory**, I guided students in understanding feedback systems, stability analysis, and controller design.  
I assisted in grading, held office hours, and supported project work, ensuring students developed a strong grasp of theoretical concepts and their practical applications.
