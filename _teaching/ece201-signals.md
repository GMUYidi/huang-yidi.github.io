As part of my teaching experience, I served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for **ECE201 Intro to Signals and Systems**.  
I helped students understand the fundamentals of signal processing, Fourier analysis, and system response.  
My role included conducting discussion sessions, grading assignments, and offering individual guidance to support student learning and problem-solving.
